Design for UA conductor

Build a differentiable policy inside of a reinforcement learning framework, that maps the current state of the project (input) to a set of actions (output). The main role of the policy is to assign tasks to contributors taking into account workload and the state of other completed deliverables.


=== Variables ===

C = number of contributors
L = number of contributor features [skill vector, days of assigned work, days of progress on current project]

D = number of deliverables
P = number of deliverable features [assign, remind, mark as completed]

Input:
* State of asignments [C x D x P]
* State of contributors [C x L]

Output:
* State of asignments [C x D x P]
