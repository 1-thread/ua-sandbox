Text2Image workflow design document

* In the text to image generation floating window under workflow
* add a pull down menu for the set of deliverable that have been assigned to the current user (determinied by profile image shown in top right corner).
* user must select a deliverable to move forward with the rest of the workflow
* once a deliverable is selected, it should reveal two text prompt fields. The first prompt is the project context prompt. The project context prompt should should include the description of the IP (from the database), the description of the deliverable (from the database) and the related acceptance criteria. Add description of theh workflow that currently being use. Also add a prompt the ensures that the user is using the appropriate workflow. For example, if the user selects the image to text workflow for power point creation, it should return an error and not run image generation. The contributors prompt below should not override the context prompt. Take all of this description into consideration and make an appropriate context prompt. The context prompt is visible to the user but cannot be edited
* The second window will be the contributors prompt. Add a note like "Add your own prompt for this deliverable..." which disappears once the editing begin. This is a mandatory field that must be filled out.
* Connect the context prompt, user prompt and image generation to OpenAI's API key for image generation. Show some kind of progress circle or dynamic thinking icon while waiting for results.
* If the user exist out of the window before results are shown, keep the process running in the back ground and when the user opens the workflow again, just load the last prompt and output from the database. This implies that the database needs to cache results so that the user can either archive or delete result. This also implies that there needs to be a delete button ater results are down.
* When the user enters a prompt and clicks on submit, the results (both text and image) should be shown in the output field.
* Add an "Archive" button. When the archive button is clicked, save both the prompt and the image to the supabase storage. The prompt and image pair should be saved to the cooresponding deliverable as a text file and image file. After the archive button or delete button is clicked, the floating workflow window should return to it's default state. 
* Archiving the results should be the same behavior as the "upload" button in the asset page, where the time and the users name is saved in the backend. This implies that archived files should also be visible in the deliverable card in the asset viewer later. one link for the prompt and one link for the image should be visible in the history of the deliverable. However, for the user name also add the model that was used. For example, "Kris Kringle (using OpenAI DALLE)"
