Contributor List Design document

* Implement contributor migration to load contributor information json to populate supabase
* Current set of contributors are saved as json files in the contributor folder

* Add "Contributor" item under "Admin" in the sidebar
* Create a contributor page when user clicks on "contributor" item
* Contributor page should have icon and title at the top similar to any other page
* Create a card for each contributor with name, expertise and role (pull from database)
* Each card should float on hover
* Each card will spawn a floating window with the same information. Also add a section for "Deliverables Completed" and "Deliverables Assigned". We will add deliverables later.
* Page will load information from database for the first time it is clicked but after that it should read from cache for faster loading
* Create one contributor card with a plus sign in the middle for "add new contributor"
* Clicking on the add new contributor card will spawn a floating window that has the name, expertise and role fields. clicking on the save button will add that new contributor to the database.
